## WeebAPI
WeebAPI is a NodeJS implementation aimed to parse and serve manga from a plethora of websites.  

## Description
This api can parse webpages on the fly and give you clean JSON in return.
Some of these websites are:
- [mangakakalot](https://mangakakalot.com/)
- [mangadex](https://mangadex.org/)
- [mnagasushi](https://mangasushi.net/)
- [readm](https://readm.org/)

These scrapers are very easy to add and will all be open source.

Accompanying this API are frontends for windows, linux, osx, android and ios. 

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Requirements
Latest NodeJS version with NPM or Yarn.
## Installation
```properties
cd backend
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

## Usage
In the following examples yarn can be replaced with npm.

Start the built api
```properties
cd backend
yarn run build
yarn start
```

### Development
```properties
yarn run dev
```

## Roadmap
Will be adding a lot more plugins to support as many websites as possible.
As of right now, all plugins rely on the content being inside of the HTML received when a GET request is done to the page, but some manga hosting websites have it setup so that you need to have their scripts load the page after you've GET-requested the page.

They do this to combat any scrapers like this.
This can be easily bypassed by using a headless browser such as Puppeteer.
## Contributing
Plugins can be contributed, but have to have their own jest tests and of course they should pass. These tests are a necessity because manga sites keep changing their DOM content so the plugins will stop working at some point. The tests can quickly show which plugins don't work and which do.

```properties
yarn jest --rootDir ./specs [spec filename]
# or
npx jest --rootDir ./specs [spec filename]
```

## Project status
This is just a side project of mine so there's not much activity other than the occasional weekend that I'm working on it.
